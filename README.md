editor for my raycasting graphics engine

I wrote this editor for my personal use during one afternoon and later added some little things.
I used some libraries I had written before. - utils.h, myGeometry.h, input.h. 
I think it's nicely written concerning the small amount of time of creation, so I decided to share it.

After starting the editor, you are asked in console for defining attributes of objects you are going to add in that session.
If you want to change some attributes after adding a few objects, you have to quit the programm ( just alt+F4, don't worry, the scene will be saved) and start it again, and define the attributes in console.

You add objects by clicking in the coordinates system.

Enjoy :)
